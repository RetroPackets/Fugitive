This tool uses a advanced google search that restricts to only finding links
that have specifically what your searching for. For example: if you search a username
with option [1] then it will display websites where the username is registered to
it will also display links with the username within the link itself, not only that
but it will also display links to where the username is simply mentioned on. This
tools also uses another tool called maigret to perform option [2] so you get
better results for the username you are searching for.
